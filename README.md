The contributions of our work are:
* We demonstrate that, using this approach, we can detect differences in AI model performance based on selected image acquisition device or physical object model parameters. Specifically, we evaluate the effect of image acquisition (radiation dose) and object model (breast and mass densities, mass size) parameters on the performance of the AI model.
* We release a synthetic dataset, M-SYNTH, to facilitate testing with pre-computed data using the proposed pipeline. The dataset consists of 1,200 stochastic knowledge-based (KB) models and their associated digital mammography (DM) images with varying physical (breast density, mass size and density) and imaging (dose) characteristics.

## Dataset
M-SYNTH is a synthetic digital mammography (DM) dataset with four breast fibroglandular density distributions imaged using Monte Carlo x-ray simulations with the publicly available [Virtual Imaging Clinical Trial for Regulatory Evaluation (VICTRE)](https://github.com/DIDSR/VICTRE) toolkit. The dataset has the following characteristics:

* Breast density: dense, hetero, scattered, fatty
* Mass radius (mm): 5.00, 7.00, 9.00
* Mass density: 1.0, 1.01, 1.1
* Relative dose: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% of the clinically recommended dose for each density

 M-SYNTH contains mammography images (in .raw and DICOM formats), metadata (breast density, mass radius, mass density, relative dose, detector) and coordinate locations of the lesion.

**New!** We also released pixel-level segmentation masks generated using VICTRE.  

Dataset is hosted on huggingface and can be downloaded at: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/didsr/msynth](https://huggingface.co/datasets/didsr/msynth)

## Code 
1. Code to show sample preprocessing, model training and inference steps is available in `code` directory.
2. Sample code to generate a single synthetic DM image with annotations and segmentation can be found in the following [VICTRE example](https://github.com/DIDSR/VICTRE_PIPELINE/tree/main/examples/msynth).
3. Examples of how to load .raw and .dcm images, obtain lesion locations and lesion segmentations can be found in the ```examples/``` folder.
